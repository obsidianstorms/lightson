## Summary

This project is an older functional but abandoned SNMP-interfacing application for use to control networking hardware.  The project had progressed to a point of successfully controlling an APC smart power strip.  Model of the power strip is currently unknown.  Sanitation has been applied to some of the configuration and the project has not been reworked to match more modern coding styles.
